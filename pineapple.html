        The pineapple (<i>Ananas comosus</i>) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; 
        it is the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae. 
        The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. 
        The introduction of the pineapple plant to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant 
        cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapples have been commercially grown in greenhouses 
        and many tropical plantations. Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the 
        unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple fruit. The plant normally propagates from the offset 
        produced at the top of the fruit or from a side shoot and typically matures within a year.
