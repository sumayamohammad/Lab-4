        A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus <i>Musa</i>. In some countries, cooking bananas are called plantains, distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit varies in size, color, and firmness but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a peel, which may have various colors when ripe. It grows in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarpic) bananas come from two wild species – <i>Musa acuminata</i> and <i>Musa balbisiana</i>, or hybrids of them.
