        Papaya (<i>Carica papaya</i>) is a tropical fruit native to southern Mexico and Central America. 
        The plant typically grows with a single stem reaching 5 to 10 meters in height, adorned with large, deeply lobed leaves at the top. 
        Its fruit is a large berry, about 15–45 cm long and 10–30 cm in diameter, featuring sweet, orange flesh and numerous black seeds. 
        Papayas are cultivated in tropical regions worldwide, with India leading global production, accounting for 38% of the world's supply in 2022.
